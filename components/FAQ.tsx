            <AccordionContent>
              When you sell one-time payment products,{" "}
              <Link className="underline" href="#">
                Stripe takes a 0.4% cut (up to $2.00)
              </Link>{" "}
              per sale. With ZenVoice, you only pay once, and never again. And
              if you don't pay for Stripe Invoicing, you will get customer
              requests asking for invoices. Stripe receipts aren't enough for
              most countries' regulations. Finally, Stripe invoices aren't
              editable. Your customers can't add VAT, Tax ID, or fix typos after
              the purchase is done. ZenVoice fixes all that.
